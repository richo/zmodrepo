# zmodrepo

At the moment, this is a proof of concept that a zsh loadable module can be
written out of tree and in Rust. Eventually the goal is to have a module that
can print repository information for Git and more importantly Mercurial much
faster than any shell implementation like zsh's included `vcs_info` or
whatever hideously slow method oh-my-zsh uses, so the prompt can be drawn
without flicker: using native code is especially important for Mercurial
because it'll make it easier to use Mercurial's command server functionality.
While forking a new process on every prompt is expensive, forking a new
_Python interpreter_ is doubly expensive.

## Compile

You'll need a version of Rust that supports Rust 2018 at the very least. I've
been using 1.38. Apart from that you'll need zsh's header files installed,
they're in zsh-dev on Ubuntu/Debian.  The usual cargo build instructions
apply:
```
cargo build --release
```

## Install

At the moment, you'll need to move the shared library file yourself. Using
`~/zmods` as an example, add this to your `.zshenv`:

```
module_path=(~/zmods $module_path)
```

Copy the shared object from the `target/release` folder and name it without
the `lib` prefix:

```
cp target/release/libmodrepo.so ~/zmods/zmodrepo
```

Now you can load the module:

```
% zmodload zmodrepo
zmodrepo loaded
% rustexample
hello from rust!
```

(This is to say that it won't crash your shell, or release demons from your
laptop's fan exhaust.)

If you're brave you can unload the module:

```
% zmodload -u zmodrepo
zmodrepo unloaded
```

And that's it!
